%Tutorial - TO command processor -----------------------------------------------
+  The TO command processor option sends a message to a user at another
+        terminal. It differs from the SEND command in that the text of the
+        message is not in quotes, so you don't have to think about doubling
+        quotes contained in your text. Also, this processor cannot put a
+        message in the broadcast mail. One or more User-id's, to whom the
+        message is to be sent, may be specified.
+        You may enter a long message that wraps to the next line.
