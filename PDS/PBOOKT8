%Search a specific argument in the Manuals list.+
 To search a specific argument in the Manuals list, enter the%FIND+ or%F+
 command in the command area at the top of the screen. You will be promped
 to a FIND panel where you may specify your desired argument to be searched
 anywhere in the Manuals list entries.
 As soon as the FIND process starts, the Manuals list entries will be sorted,
 if necessary, to search for LE (ascending order) or GE (descending order) in
 the corresponding field (i.e. MANUAL, KEY-1, DATE, ROOM, ...) as indicated
 by the requested argument, unless the search is to be done on the TITLE or
 NEWSLETTERS fields (in this case, the scan is executed in the Manuals list
 entries as they are sorted at this moment just because only a true match
 of the argument will satisfy the found condition).
%Exceptional continue search+is allowed only when the FIND command is working
 on the TITLE field by entering the%CONT+command successively (alias%CONTINUE+
 or%C+ are accepted).
