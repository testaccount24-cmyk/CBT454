%Tutorial - SNAKE - A program for TSO 3270 terminals ---------------------------
+Notes  :+Any other input, or trying to move through an obstruction, is
          equivalent to standing still while the snake gets a move. Note that
          running is stopped by an obstruction, but only after failing a move
          attempt, thus giving the snake an extra move. Any snake trail data
          present is cleared by a screen image RESHOW/REFRESH.
          Running can be speeded up by activating BURST MODE. When this is done
          consecutive running moves are displayed with one TPUT, thus optimizing
          terminal I/O. However, depending upon the terminal and its controller,
          each individual move may be invisible and the user will be presented
          with the final screen image.
          If file ISPTABL is allocated, then the highest score is kept as user
          data (PFD STATS, not SPF) of member SNKTAB## (REVIEW will show PFD
          and SPF STATS) where ## is the number of lines that the screen has.
          If invoked as HALFSNAK or HS, then only the top half (integer
          arithmetic) of the screen will be used. Naturally a different
          scoreboard member will be used. Similarly with QUARTERS and QS.
          If the terminal's VTAM QUERY bit is ON, then a QUERY will be done to
          determine if 3270 Extended Data Stream data can be sent.
