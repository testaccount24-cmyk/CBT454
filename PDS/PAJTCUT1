                      -----------------------------------
+
%1+-write lines from a file to the user profile POOL for later inclusion by the
    INSERT option.
   %SYNTAX :+CUT (default level is 1) or CUT LN (level-number)
   %RESTRICTION :+the level-number may range between 1 and 99 included only.
%USE :+      Enter%CUT+on the command line and use the%C+or%M+line commands (in
             any form) to select the lines to be cut. If the%M+line command is
             used, the indicated lines are%deleted+(reset to blanks) after they
             have been copied. A level-number may be used to separate different
             levels of CUT. This way you can make many CUTs before you INSERT.
             If the level-number is omited, level 1 is assumed and anything in
             the level 1 will be overlayed.
             CUT%3+(or any number) will CUT the indicated line(s) into level%3+
             (or level indicated) and can be INSERTed using the level-number.
