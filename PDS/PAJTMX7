 To enter notes or other text pertaining to a mail-box, use the%MAILBOX+
 command or the%M+line-command.

 To update (or create) a mail-box entry, enter%M+in the action area of the mail
 with the desired number and hit%ENTER.+You will be taken into EDIT mode on the
 mail-boxes data-set member for the selected mail-box number. Enter changes,
 then hit%&EPF+to resave. Enter%Mn+to update or create sequentially the%n+
 successive mail-box entries starting from the one selected by the line-command.

 To edit the mail-boxes data-set using a member selection list, enter the
 %MAILBOX+command in the command area. This will take you to a member selection
 list for the mail-boxes data-set, so you can then select the desired member
 in the usual manner (enter%S+in the action area). Note that you cannot use
 this option if the data-set has no members... you must create one or more
 members using the%M+line-command first (see above).
