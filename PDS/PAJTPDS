%Tutorial - PDSMATCH - Compare two PDS directories -----------------------------
+
% Purpose+: this program compares the directories of two partitioned data-sets
+           and shows which members match and which members do not match or are
+           not present in both directories.
+
+           Members are said to match if their names are the same, and (if
+           option USER) if all the other data in their directory entries are
+           equal (except fields containing TTR track addresses).
+           Data records for the members are not compared.
+           Only the information in the directory is compared.
+
+           When volume serials are used to indicate two identically named
+           data-sets on different volumes are being used, unexpected results
+           can occur unless both are specified.
