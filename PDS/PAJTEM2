%VERSION :+
   Use%VERSION+to change the version level of the member being edited (STATS
   must be ON). The version level can be entered as a number in the range 1-99.
   VERSION has no effect on the modification level (it is not reset to zero
   when the version number is changed).
%LEVEL :+
   Use%LEVEL+to change the modification level of the member being edited (STATS
   must be ON). The modification level can be entered as a number in the range
   0-99. Normally, the modification level is automatically incremented  by one
   when the first change is made to the data. Automatic incrementing is
   suppressed under the following conditions :
        - If it is a new member (mod level remains at 00),
        - If a LEVEL has already been set.
