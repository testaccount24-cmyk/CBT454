                      |       Edit Macro  "BLOCK"       |
                      -----------------------------------
+
             To enter a string of characters containing any command delimiter
             character(s) or to type very long strings, as many as you can get
             on a line of data, enter the string of characters on a data line
             within the text. Type%BLOCK+on the command line, move the cursor
             to the line with the string typed on it, and press enter.
             The entire line pointed by the cursor will be read, all leading
             blanks eliminated, and then used as string of characters.
             Spacing is up to you, thus you must plan your text so that it
             appears the way you want it.
             The line with the string of characters text is preserved.
