 %RH      +Remove Hyphens and reconnect words
           Remove Hyphens means if you have one word split across multiple li-
           nes with a hyphen (like li- nes in this sentence), the hyphen (-)
           will be removed and the word will be reconnected into one word (i.e.
           lines) before reformatting occurs.
           Why have this routine ? Two reasons :
            (1) Suppose you made an error previously when you executed PARA,
                making NL and NR too close together. If PARA finds a word that
                cannot fit between NL and NR, PARA splits the word into two or
                more pieces, hyphenating them. Many words might have been split
                into pieces. This routine makes recovery easy : just execute
                PARA with the correct NL/NR pair and RH.
            (2) Suppose you are modifying old text, with many words hyphenated.
                Your changes will shift the position of the hyphenated words
                within the paragraph, moving the hyphenated words to the middle
                of the line. This routine saves a lot of manual unhyphenation
                time.
