+  Gregorian calendar :
+  It was made up by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 to correct the Julian calendar,
+  which Julius Caesar worked out in 46 b.c.
+  The Julian calendar year was 11 minutes and 14 seconds longer than the solar
+  year. By a.d. 1580, this difference had accumulated to 10 days. Pope Gregory
+  dropped 10 days from October 1582 (the day that would have been October 5
+  became October 15) to make the calendar year correspond more closely to the
+  solar year. He also decreed that each fourth year would be a leap year, when
+  February would have an extra day. Years marking the century would not be
+  leap years unless divisible by 400. For example, 1600 was a leap year, but
+  1700, 1800, and 1900 were not.
+  The Gregorian calendar is so accurate that the difference between the
+  calendar and solar years is now only about 26.3 seconds. This difference
+  will increase by .53 second every hundred years, because the solar year is
+  gradually growing shorter. By the year 4316, it will have gained one day
+  on the sun.
