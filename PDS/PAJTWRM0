%Tutorial - WORM - A program for TSO 3270 terminals ----------------------------
%Method :+once the WORM is moving ten (10) TGETs are done one-tenth of a second
          apart. If no input is received the WORM is moved one location in the
          current direction. When WORMomatic is active, only one (1) TGET is
          done when in burst mode, or two (2) TGETs one-tenth of a second apart
          otherwise. The current meaning of PF1 (displayed in the title line)
          and the move speed indicate the current AUTOMATIC/MANUAL/BURST mode
          status.
          An optional operand of one or two decimal digits may be supplied to
          specifies a target upper limit to TASK-TYPE CPU time consumption by
          WORMomatic expressed in terms of percentage of elapsed time. The
          default of zero means that WORMomatic will not try to limit its CPU
          service absorption rate.
