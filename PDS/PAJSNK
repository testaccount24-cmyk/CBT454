%Object :+to pick up as many $25 bundles as possible and make it "home" without
          being eaten by the snake. Money is denoted by a $, the player by a I,
          "home" by #, and the snake by a string of S's in lower case, with the
          snake's head being in upper case. Each time the player moves the snake
          moves. At first the snake will move almost randomly, but will make an
          "intelligent" move more often as the game progresses. When the player
          gets "home" the game ends and the score is credited. If the player
          gets "eaten" then the game ends and no score is credited.
