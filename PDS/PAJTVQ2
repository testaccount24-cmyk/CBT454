 The previous panel displayed the ENQ information you requested. The first line
 below the command line displayed the nature of the request :

 &T1                                                                           +

 This was followed by column headings and their corresponding data :

%TYPE  +- the type of ENQ : SHR means the resource is to be shared, EXCL means
          the resource is to be owned exclusively by the owner.
%STATUS+- the status of the ENQ request : OWNER means the request has been
          satisfied, WAITING means the requestor is waiting for the resource.
%SCOPE +- the scope of the ENQ request : SYSTEM requests are only for the SYSTEM
          on which the requestor is running, SYSTEMS are for all systems in the
          GRS configuration.
%MAJOR +- the major name of the resource (e.g., for a data-set ENQ, "SYSDSN").
%MINOR +- the minor name of the resource (e.g., for a data-set ENQ, the data-set
          name).
