%Tutorial - PDSMATCH - Compare two PDS directories -----------------------------
+
+ Eventually, supply options :
+       %USER +- members that are present in both libraries will be compared
+                for matching USER-DATA (consists of up to 64 bytes of data in
+                the directory entry which is put there by the linkage editor,
+                SPF edit, and others).
+                Note : with USER, if two members have the same name and neither
+                       has any USER-DATA, they are treated as unequal, with a
+                       unique message for this case.
+       %EQO  +- only members that match will be listed.
+       %NEO  +- (or SHORT) only members that don't match will be listed.
+        If neither of the above, all members will be listed for both libraries.
+
%  Size in K+: set the 2 PDS directories core storage space size to ...K size
+        (default is 128K). Usefull to avoid an abend S800 if big directories.
