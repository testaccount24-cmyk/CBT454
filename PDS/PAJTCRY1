%WARNING :+  If you forget the KEYVALUE that you used to encipher the data,
             KISS THE DATA GOOD-BYE because there is no way of deciphering
             the data again. If you are hopelessly paranoid, you can encipher
             the enciphered data with a different KEYVALUE to really grunge up
             the data. The decipherion process must be the exact inverse of the
             encipher process in order to recover the original data again.
%EXAMPLES :+ 1) to encipher the data with the key of ALPHA, type : !CRY E,ALPHA
                and to get it back to clear text again, type : !CRY D,ALPHA
             2) to really garbage up the data with keys of ALPHA and BRAVO,
                type : !CRY E,ALPHA and then after !CRY E,BRAVO
                and to decipher the text, just reverse the order as follows,
                type : !CRY D,BRAVO and then after !CRY D,ALPHA
%RANGE :+    You may also limit the encryption-decryption by marking a range of
             lines of text with the "C" range command on the line numbers.
