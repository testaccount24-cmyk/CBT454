                      |       Edit Macro  "BLOCK"       |
                      -----------------------------------
+
%FUNCTION :+ This Edit macro may be used to create multiple block characters
             in your text (Super-Type Text macro).
%SYNTAX :+   BLOCK T=string of characters to generate after pointed line
            %Warning :+ If the string of characters must contain any command
                        delimiter character (special character for command
                        stacking, see ISPF option 0.1), you must use the next
                        way of entering the command, otherwise the string will
                        be truncated at first encountered delimiter character,
                        and the rest will be handled as another command, which
                        probably would be invalid.
             BLOCK or BLOCK T= and string of characters to generate read from
                                   pointed line
             BLOCK HELP or H
