                      -----------------------------------

%USE :+      Type%BLOCK+on the command line followed by%T=+string of characters
             that you wish to have in block letters in your text. Then place the
             cursor on the line where you want the text is to be inserted. The
             block characters text will be created starting at line after where
             the cursor is (if it is not within a data line, the first line is
             assumed as cursor position). An attempt will be made to center the
             text if only one line of block characters is created. If more than
             one block-line (requires five data lines) is needed, the starting
             characters (including spaces) will be on the first indicated block-
             line, a line is skipped and the next group is created. If more than
             two block-lines are needed, the next are created after skipping
             another line, and so on.
            %Warning :+Remember no command delimiter character in the string.
