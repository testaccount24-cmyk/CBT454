                      -----------------------------------

%FUNCTION :+ These Edit macros perform the ENCRYPTION or DECRYPTION of data
             operating as a primary command under ISPF-PDF EDIT.
%OPERATION :+the ENCRYPTION or DECRYPTION is performed by utilizing a KEY-VALUE
             you are prompted to supply it unviewable. The KEY-VALUE is a user
             supplied keyword which is used as ENCRYPT-DECRYPT code value. The
             keyword is limited to eight bytes in length, but may be shorter.
%SYNTAX :+      ENCRYPT or               DECRYPT or
                ENCRYPT HELP or H        DECRYPT HELP or H
%WARNING :+  If you forget the KEY-VALUE that you used to encipher the data,
             KISS THE DATA GOOD-BYE because there is no way of deciphering the
             data again. If you are hopelessly paranoid, you can encipher the
             enciphered data with a different KEY-VALUE to really grunge up the
             data. The decipherion process must be the exact inverse of the
             encipher process in order to recover the original data again.
%RANGE :+    You may also limit the encryption-decryption by marking a range of
             lines of text with the "C" range command on the line numbers.
