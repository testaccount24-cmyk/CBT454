%Tutorial - WORM - A program for TSO 3270 terminals ----------------------------
+        %ENTER+causes a move in the current direction to be made immediately.
         %PA+keys and%PF+keys 1/13, 2/14, 4/16, 5/17 and 6/18 are the only ones
          which will not stop WORMomatic while it is ACTIVE.
         %ATTENTION+interrupt%(PA1)+stops WORMomatic.
%Notes  :+If the terminal's VTAM QUERY bit is on then arrows are used for the
          WORM instead of lower case O's (this also means UNWINDING information
          is available to the player), the @ for the head is repalced by a Blob,
          and the target number will be displayed in reverse video. An alternate
          graphic display mode is available which shows the WORM as a continuous
          line and the head as a block. Line mode is simulated in non-graphic
          mode with dashes, etc... The initial WORM is white, but each WORM food
          target is artificially coloured at random. No preservatives added. The
          WORM will gradually take on the colour of the most recently consumed
          food. No two consecutive food targets will have the same colour.
          7-colour displays are only transmitted in "graphic" mode. PF6/18 is
          available to ACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE "graphic" mode, which is initially
          on only if the VTAM QUERY bit for the TSO terminal is on and the
          QUERY indicated 7-colour support.
