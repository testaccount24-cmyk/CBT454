%Tutorial - STATDS - Data-set Statistics ---------------------------------------
+  This function formats information on any disk data-set. It reads through the
+  entire data-set and outputs disk track usage, blocksize and other statistics.
+  If a%no PARM+is coded, the following information will be given :
+      a) DCB and DSCB characteristics.
+      b) Record counts, record size, track usage statistics for any type of
+         data-set organization. For DSORG=IS, it reads through the entire
+         data-set (there may be up to three separate files of data and reports
+         on each file). Also, the ISAM label (format 2 DSCB) record will be
+         read and a data-set profile which includes data-set reorganization
+         data and data-set characteristics will be provided.
+      c) For DSORG=PO, the directory TTR's will be compared against actual
+         disk addresses to determine the TTRs of "gas" members (the first 72
+         characters of any "gas" member are outputed). Statistics are
+         maintained on the size of "gas" and "real" members and the number of
+         alias members. If any aliases are in the data-set, a check is made
+         to see that corresponding real entries also exist.
+  A PARM of%'NO'+nullify the gas TTR report.
+  A PARM of%'LABEL'+give only DCB and DSCB characteristics.
+  A PARM of%'FULL'+supply the directory members list (only DSORG=PO).
+  A PARM of%'GAS(TT.TT.RR)'+add a member name to the directory for the "gas"
+      member having the specified TTR location (in HEX from a previous run).
+  Depress%PF3+or%PF15+to return to the%STATDS+panel.
